This module provides mappers between the Hadoop.TS 
data structures and JCuda, as well as Cuda-Kernel
implementations for JCuda, together with example code, 
ready for usage in the Cloudera datascience workbench. 

The examples show generation of random number series 
and detrended fluctuation analysis.
